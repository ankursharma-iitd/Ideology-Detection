Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , while clarifying the points raised by members , said it had been judicially settled in many countries , including the United States , that if an individual wants to claim specific government benefits , asking him or her to enrol for a Aadhaar like programme is not unjust .

Last month the SC ruled that Aadhaar can only be issued to those with proven Indian nationality and can not be mandatory for accessing public services and subsidies .
